We got our inspiration for this project from the SCP Foundation, which stands for Secure, Contain, Protect. SCPs are essentially a collective creative writing project in which users get to create items and/or concepts that bend reality. For the backend of our project we used MongoDB as our database, Mongoose for our schemas, and Express for the routing. A link for our front end can be found below.
